This is performed by pushing the control stick perpendicular to your launch angle, and will shift it in the direction you push. In Smash 4, you could change your angle by about 9.7 degrees. DIing towards someone is usually referred to as "DI in" and DIing away from someone is usually referred to as "DI out". There are two major applications for DI- combo DI and survival DI\n\nKeep in mind there is a second mechanic you must use in conjunction with DI known as LSI. See also - Combo DI, Survival DI, LSI',

   'combo di':
    { definition:
       'Combo DI allows you to escape combos by changing your launch angle in a way that you get hit farther from the opponent.

    { definition:
       'Survival DI allows you to survive kill moves by changing your launch angle in a way that makes you take more time to reach the blast zones. For instance, against Mewtwo\'s up throw, you can DI away from him to survive longer. See also - DI, Combo DI, LSI',
      character: 'General' },
   lsi:
    { definition:
       'LSI, short for Launch Speed Influence, is a mechanic that allows you to change the speed you are launched at. It only applies if the launch angle is between 65 and 295 degrees. The method to perform it is simple- hold up to fly faster, hold down to fly slower! However, its applications are much more complicated. This comes from the fact that you can use both DI and LSI at the same time. This matters because *DIing down is not good* in most situations. There\'s 2 reasons for this: 1) DIing down makes it harder to recover, because you have less time to drift and 2) it makes you reach the blast zone quicker.\n\nTo avoid this problem, you must find the angle that takes advantage of both good DI and good LSI. On more horizontal moves, this is usually simply in, which only takes advantage of DI. On diagonal launch angles, however, this is usually down and in. The down part is for LSI, the in part is for DI. Breaking it down further, the down input slows your momentum and the in part makes you take longer to reach the blast zone.\n\nThere is another mechanic related to LSI that makes certain moves kill at much later percents- LSI is applied after DI. This means if a move launches you outside of the LSI range originally (i.e. at 70 degrees) and you DI it into the LSI range, you can also begin to LSI it. For example, Charizard\'s Smash 4 UThrow had an angle of 70 degrees and you could hold down and away to remove most of its kill potential. Not only is this angle perfect to bring it into LSI range, but it also DIs the *vertical* half of it, by DIing away from Charizard as well.\n\nFinally, if you played Melee, you will know the optimal survival DI for diagonal or horizontal moves was up. In SSBU, **this will kill you. Do not do it.** While this angle is the correct *DI*, it is the incorrect *LSI*. In this situation, LSI takes more effect, and you die sooner. Make sure whenever you DI something, your DI "agrees" with your LSI. See also - DI',
